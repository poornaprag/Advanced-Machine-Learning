###  Multi-task Learning
By sharing representations between related tasks, we can enable our model to generalize better on our original task. This approach is called Multi-Task Learning (MTL).

### Meta Learning
Meta-Learning:
Learning new concepts and skills fast with a few training examples.
Adapting to new tasks and new environments that have never been encountered during training time. 
The adaptation process, essentially a mini learning session, happens during test but with a limited exposure to the new task configurations. 
Eventually, the adapted model can complete new tasks. This is why meta-learning is also known as learning to learn.

### Implemented the following:

- 4a. Multi task learning (MTL) with NLP and hugging face transformers
- 4b. Meta learning with FOMAML
- 4e. (Extra Credit) Meta Learning with Reptile


Also, currently working on other algorithms MTL and Meta Learning.
